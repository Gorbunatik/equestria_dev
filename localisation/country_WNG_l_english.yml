 WNG_garibald_talonuel_iii:0 "Garibald Talonuel III"
 WNG_garibald_talonuel_iii_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 11th November 940, Karthin, Wingbardy.\n\n§YBiography§!: Known as the 'Soldier King' due to his leadership during the Falcor War, Garibald Talonuel III is well respected and beloved by the Wingbardian griffons. In 972 ALB his father, King Gumberto, was murdered in the Imperial Palace in Griffenheim while attending a party for the young Grover V. The newly crowned Garibald demanded justice but was given none. In protest he severed all ties with the Empire, declaring Wingbardy to be independent for the first time in over a century. The rest of the empire soon took Wingbardy's lead, quickly leading to the Empire's collapse.\n\nThe first few years of independence was prosperous for Wingbardy, however a border dispute with Falcor in 985 lead to four long and bloody years of conflict that scarred Wingbardy to this day. During the war, King Garibald Talonuel III was known to often visit the frontline and had significant support among his troops.\n\nHowever, the years since the war have only seen Wingbardy's situation grown worse. Failed government after failed government, along with a crippled economy, has lead to many Wingbardians demanding that he step in and find a way to resolve their situation. With the rise of Fascism and Communism, it became clear that only he could decide Wingbardy's future.\n\nHe sees his son, Gumberto, as a disappointment and secretly fears for the future of the monarchy unless his son can better himself. In the King's free time he is an avid stamp collector. His collection of postal stamps is the largest in the world.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Sinister"

 WNG_political_deadlock:0 "Political Deadlock"
 WNG_political_deadlock_desc:0 "The Falcor War left the nation in a state of chaos. What was supposed to be a triumph quickly turned into a farce. So much Wingbardian blood was shed for only a few miles of Falcorian land and a single city devastated by the war. With the collapsing economy and the growing distrust of successive failed governments, the Wingbardian political system is in shatters and few see how it can survive without reform or revolution."
 WNG_political_deadlock_tt:0 "§RThis national spirit will only be removed if a party or coalition rules with a majority of seats in the Chamber of Deputies.§!"
 WNG_economic_crisis:0 "Economic Crisis"
 WNG_economic_crisis_desc:0 "Wingbardy experienced rapid industrial growth during the last few years of the Empire. However, the collapse of the Empire and the long, bloody war with Falcor has left the nation in catastrophic economic decline.\nNow there is rampant unemployment.

 WNG_outdated_army:0 "Outdated Army"
 WNG_outdated_army_desc:0 "Since our triumph in the long, brutal years of the Falcor war, it has become apparent that our pride in victory has come with some downsides. Our military is still rooted in the tactics that won us the city of Falcor and has been reluctant to innovate using new modern methods. We will need to fix this if we are to face any threats to our nation's survival."

 WNG_prepare_the_counterrevolution:0 "Rally the Anti-Fascists"
 WNG_prepare_the_counterrevolution_desc:0 "Beakolini's march is the final insult to the freedom of the Wingbardian griffons. We have one final chance to stop fascist authoritarianism from taking over our country and to break the fasces before it strikes us all down. Now is the darkest hour, when we must lay down the hammer and take up the rifle to protect our country and our ideals from Beakolini's fascist hordes!"
  
 WNG_arm_the_red_guard:0 "Arm the Red Guard"
 WNG_arm_the_red_guard_desc:0 "Comrade, forget about the politicians, there is no time. The Red Guard is an organisation of tough griffons who fought the blackwing claw to claw in many street brawls. We must call them together once more and raid guns from the Karthin armoury. They are determined to teach the fascists a lesson of lead and you shouldn't turn down their help now."

 WNG_evacuate_the_chamber_of_Deputies:0 "Evacuate the Chamber of Deputies"
 WNG_evacuate_the_chamber_of_Deputies_desc:0 "Blackwing vanguards are patrolling the streets close to parliament with most of the liberal politicians still inside with their staff. I'm begging you, you must save our elected representatives from these thugs. Yes, they can't fight, but their support will be crucial in the upcoming conflict. In the name of democracy, please launch a rescue operation now!"

 WNG_mobilise_the_trade_unions:0 "Mobilise the Trade Unions"
 WNG_mobilise_the_trade_unions_desc:0 "Do not be fooled when Beakolini says he speaks for the working griffon, the unions are with you until the end. You must give the order for a general strike now, comrade, before the chaos is complete. That way we will be able to secure crucial factories and machinery for the war effort. The worker will win the war against fascism, comrade, put your faith in us!"

 WNG_anti_fascist_propoganda:0 "Anti-Fascist Propaganda"
 WNG_anti_fascist_propoganda_desc:0 "Beakolini has blamed the union, parliament, socialism, ponies and a thousand other things for the miserable state of our politics. In the name of freedom of speech, we have allowed his platform to poison the public's minds. No longer! We will tear down every fascist poster, silence every speaker and rally the worker to the red flag! If you but give us the order. . ."

 WNG_reach_out_to_stalliongrad:0 "Reach out to Stalliongrad"
 WNG_reach_out_to_stalliongrad_desc:0 "Friends, I have some contacts across the ocean in Stalliongrad, the pony workers' republic. The marksists there are well armed and with luck, their support could reach us in time. Please give me the order, and I will make arrangements with their government. No griffon wants to rely on foreign support, but the reactionaries leave us little choice."

 WNG_push_the_liberals_out_of_power:0 "Push the Liberals out of Power"
 WNG_push_the_liberals_out_of_power_desc:0 "We are victorious, comrades. The fascists have thrown themselves at us and they have died a coward's death. The battle has proven once and for all that the harmonist liberals wavered even when all their ideals were put to the test. The griffons of Wingbardy have seen us lead the fight and they want our leadership and no more indecisiveness. Long live the Revolution!"

 WNG_reach_out_to_the_liberal_generals:0 "Reach Out to Liberal Generals"
 WNG_reach_out_to_the_liberal_generals_desc:0 "The military is not completely beyond saving. I implore you, let me speak to some of generals, there are those who are not warmongering imperialists. If we show them our intentions are pure and we only act in the name of liberty and democracy, we will be able to sway them to our side. Fervour alone won't win us this war, we need military leadership."

 WNG_secure_police_support:0 "Sway the Carabinieri"
 WNG_secure_police_support_desc:0 "Look, we do not deny the carabinieri have been heavy clawed towards the red guard and other socialist gatherings before, but most of them hate the blackwing rabble even more. As long as they know we will not let the country descend into anarchy, the police will join forces with us. Do we not require every griffon who can shoot a rifle?"

 WNG_promise_labour_reforms:0 "Promise Labour Reforms"
 WNG_promise_labour_reforms_desc:0 "Past governments have not been able to get us out of the economic slump, that much is true. But the conservatives were the ones stopping reforms to the labour market to ensure you would all earn a living wage, and now they'd rather throw in their lot with Beakolini than pay you what you are due! Sweep them aside in the upcoming battle, and a new democratic government will deliver for every griffon in Wingbardy!"

 WNG_a_victory_for_the_unitary_socialists:0 "Victory for the Unitary Socialists"
 WNG_a_victory_for_the_unitary_socialists_desc:0 "The Socialist Party split due to disagreements about the bourgeois democracy of the country. The Partito Socialista Unitario argues to preserve the current democratic system and use it as a foundation to work towards socialism. This moderate democratic take on socialism has prevailed in the election with many unitary candidates taking seats from more hard-core socialists and from liberals."

 WNG_take_over_the_socalist_party:0 "Take over the Socialist Party"
 WNG_take_over_the_socalist_party_desc:0 "The election has massively increased the position of Giacomo Gatteotti, leader of the unitary wing of the socialist party. He has enough support from the party to call for a congress and become the leader of the Partito Socialista, side-lining the more radical socialists and clearing the way for a stable left-wing government."

 WNG_reconcile_with_the_capitalists:0 "Reconcile with the Capitalists"
 WNG_reconcile_with_the_capitalists_desc:0 "The threat of fascism is existential at the moment, and must remain our foremost priority. As it stands, some of our best engineers and scientists are stuck in the employ of the capitalists, who are still hiding abroad or in remote areas of the country. For the common good, the government must swallow her pride and invite these griffons back into important positions."

 WNG_our_new_place_in_the_world:0 "Our New Place in the World"
 WNG_our_new_place_in_the_world_desc:0 "Ever since the collapse of the Griffonian Empire, Wingbardy has been a stabilising factor in the South of Griffonia, mainly through the influence exerted by the Karthinian Pact. The old prime minister, although his pacifism was admirable, did not wish to use that influence for good. It is time to reconsider that policy and figure out Wingbardy's place in the world."

 WNG_the_republican_cause:0 "The Republican Cause"
 WNG_the_republican_cause_desc:0 "In 978 the griffons dared to dream and ever since then, that dream has not died yet. The cause of liberty has defenders yet on this continent! Let us align ourselves with our fellow republicans and help put an end to tyranny. We will not accept anything less than our dreams becoming a reality!"

 WNG_unite_the_south:0 "Unite the South"
 WNG_unite_the_south_desc:0 "To secure the Republic and prevent further bloodshed, we must align with likeminded republican nations in the south. Asterion and Sicameon are the two most likely candidates for such an alliance of free republics. A southern alliance will surely give any would be tyrant pause before attacking!"

 WNG_rebuild_the_pact:0 "Rebuild the Pact"
 WNG_rebuild_the_pact_desc:0 "Our old allies are our most reliable partners. They are the countries we understand the most and share the most history with. Our government may have changed, but our need for security has not. Thus, it makes sense to rebuild the Karthinian Pact and take the lead ourselves."

 WNG_end_fascism_in_the_south:0 "End Fascism in the South"
 WNG_end_fascism_in_the_south_desc:0 "Beakolini may be gone, but his perfidious ideology and its offshoots and precursors still haunt the griffons of Southern Griffonia. It is time to raise the flag of war once more and proof on the field of battle that the ideology of strength can never stand against an ideology of freedom and equality."

 WNG_restore_democracy_to_aquilia:0 "Restore Democracy to Aquilia"
 WNG_restore_democracy_to_aquilia_desc:0 "Democracy was the dream of the common Aquilians however their voices have been supressed by their tyrannical king. We must intervene on their behalf to ensure the restoration of Liberté, égalité, and fraternité."

#Wingbardian Republican Party - Partito Repubblicano Wingbardo - Harmony
 WNG_a_victory_for_the_republicans:0 "Victory for the Republicans"
 WNG_a_victory_for_the_republicans_desc:0 "The Republican Party of Wingbardy was a small party before the civil war, as many liberal voters saw the republic as a pipedream with a popular King and a conservative country. However, their fervent support for the liberal side in the civil war has proven the doubters wrong and earned the party its first election victory!"

 WNG_crackdown_on_the_mafia:0 "Reinstate the Pretori"
 WNG_crackdown_on_the_mafia_desc:0 "The rule of law requires that criminals cannot go unpunished. The new republic cannot allow a parallel authority to exist, but previous attempts of law enforcement to crack down on the mafia have always floundered. To represent the renewal of our fight against crime and our dedication to the high ideals of the Karthinian Republic, the ancient office of the Pretori shall be restored."

 WNG_reform_the_justice_system:0 "Reform the Justice System"
 WNG_reform_the_justice_system_desc:0 "The Republic must seize the opportunity, while the momentum is present, to reform the justice system. The backlog and stalling of judicial procedures, the lack of impartial judges and police officers and arcane legal texts must all be dealt with. The law must protect what is good and not allow refuge for what is bad. With this reform, perhaps, we can deal a permanent blow to organised crime in this country."

 WNG_draw_up_the_new_constitution:0 "Draw up the New Constitution"
 WNG_draw_up_the_new_constitution_desc:0 "“Conscious of their responsibility towards each other, inspired by the endeavours for justice and liberty in our past and by others everywhere, the griffons of this land, in the exercise of their sovereign power, have adopted this constitution. We proclaim that this nation shall be a Republic now and forevermore. We reject the tyranny of Kings.”\n-Preamble to the Constitution of the Republic"

 WNG_knights_of_the_old_republic:0 "Knights of the Old Republic"
 WNG_knights_of_the_old_republic_desc:0 "The Golden Age of the Karthinian Republic was a time full of great statesgriffons, philosophers, artists and military leaders. The ones who have persisted the most in the popular imagination, however, were the Knights of the Old Republic, the Celeres. With the 1700 year old memory of the golden age awakening once more, many griffons seek to emulate the ancient heroes. And the Republic will need many heroes."

 WNG_the_rise_of_the_republic:0 "Rise of the Republic"
 WNG_the_rise_of_the_republic_desc:0 "We have beaten crime, restored the rule of law and brought security to the young Republic. To finish our rise and break with the old kingdom, we will restore the old Karthinian Senate in the stead of the disgraced house of deputies. And after we tidied the house, perhaps we will take a look around the neighbourhood."

 WNG_cut_economic_red_tape:0 "Cut Economic Red Tape"

He was instrumental in the collapse of the Griffonian Empire, protected the south from Imperial aggression and united the nation through the long and bloody war with Falcor. Garibald Talonuel was also a prolific coin collector with over 100,000 coins in his private collection, each of them personally documented and studied. He left his collection to the National Karthinian Museum for all Wingbardians to enjoy.\n\nThe throne now passes to his son Prince Gumberto, who is a mere shadow of his father.

La Marcia Reale d'Ordinanza has been the national anthem for close to 100 years, but ever since Beakolini and his Fascist took power their own anthem, Giovinezza, has (often forcefully) supplanted it. Those loyal to the King see this as a great betrayal of Wingbardian tradition, but the King has remained silent on the issue. There is now a debate in parliament on whether la Marcia Reale d'Ordinanza should be officially replaced by Giovinezza as the official national anthem of the nation.\n\nIt is expected to go the Blackshirt's way, after all, la Marcia Reale d'Ordinanza has no official lyrics while Giovinezza has such wonderful verses as \"With a Wingbardian's pride swear fealty to Beakolini\". This mandatory anthem is merely the griffons showing how much they love Il Duce. \n\nUnlike his father, Prince Gumberto has not remained silent on the issue. He has instead proposed La Leggenda del Piumave as a compromise. The popular song dates to the Falcor War and tales of the flooding of the river Piumave, halting Falcor's invasion of Wingbardy shortly after the disastrous battle at Clawporetto and how it allowed the Regio Esercito time to launch the counter attack required to push Falcor back and to final victory at the battle of Garibald Gergamo.\n\nWith the debate being held, who will carry the day?"

Just a few hours before, Beakolini had made a simple announcement regarding the PNF's political program. They would rule Wingbardy by the end of the day, no matter the cost. \n\nAnd the cost would be steep indeed, as Karthin's inhabitants would come to find out over the next few hours. The blackwings moved quickly to secure control over the city's police stations, railways, and other institutions. Arrayed against them were the city's police forces and various anti-fascist paramilitary groups that had risen to resist the blackwings.\n\nGunfire echoed through the streets as the cities defenders hurriedly set up barricades. The offices of liberal newspapers and political parties were looted and burnt to the ground. Critics of the PNF were tracked down and punished. Parliament itself was invaded and occupied by the blackwings after a short battle. The only building that remained untouched was the royal palace, but this was cold comfort to the city's ordinary inhabitants.\n\nAs night fell, the burning buildings stood out like torches, providing ample illumination for the citizens to appreciate how far the eternal city had fallen. Shortly after, relief finally came to the city's beleaguered residents, as King Talonuel invited Beakolini to form a government over the radio. The new fascist government seems intent on stabilizing the situation, but much damage has been done."

Assuming that the relationship between the King and prime minister Ventriglio's government was deteriorating and by adding a little pressure to the mix, he could sever it completely.\n\nThis proved to be an astute observation. The King's unwillingness to declare martial law has lead to the resignation of prime minister Ventriglio and the collapse of the PLW's government. The King was unwilling the work with the communists. The PLW was out of power for the foreseeable future. This state of affairs left Beakolini and his PNF as the last griffons standing.\n\nA triumphant Beakolini entered the Royal Palace this morning, invited by the King to form a new government. However, the participants in his march looked somewhat embarrassed to have their thunder stolen from them. While nothing is set in stone yet, it seems unlikely that anything will derail Beakolini's ascent to power at the last moment. "

In addition, they offer to recognise us as the de jure government of our territory and establish full diplomatic relations with us. Although this deal seems quite favourable, many Stalliongradians question Beakolini's motives.

The area was seized by Count Francis VIII after a republican uprising which had overthrown the local Discret Countess. After the monarchist restoration, Francistrian army refused to vacate the territory as Francis VIII asserted his dynastic claim to Tarrin. Weakened by revolution, Aquileia did not dare to get into a conflict with the Karthinian Pact.\n\nNow, dignitaries from all parties involved are gathering to resolve the tensions, so the diplomatic relations between Aquileia, Francistria and Wingbardy can be normalized.

Already the negotiations have been tense, as Aquileians demanded the return of their rightful territory while Francistria asserted its own claims. Wingbardy was in the best role to act as a mediator between the two parties, as it had little interest in the disputed region.\n\nAquileian representatives said that the claim of late Count Francis VIII was illegitimate as Count Francis I had been a bastard of the Discret dynasty. Francistrians countered this by saying that the land compensated the losses Count Francis VIII had suffered while toppling the lawless Republic of Tarrin. In addition, they highlighted the similarities between Tarrinian and Francistrian cultures, and pointed out that over the decades thousands of colonists had settled the area. Aquileians countered by saying cultural similarities hardly justified military conquest and that the colonists were living on property seized from the locals.\n\nThis back and forth continued with no end in sight. Wingbardian delegates needed to intervene and propose a solution that would end the pointless squabbling. However, would they try to please either side, or try to come up with a compromise that might leave both sides unhappy?"
 wingbardy.20.a:0 "All of Tarrin belongs to Aquileia."

This meant the Wingbardian army would not intervene and allow Aquileians to occupy Tarrin fully.\n\nOf course, this was an irresistible offer for the Aquileian diplomats, who happily agreed to it. However, Francistrians may yet protest this proposal, so the outcome of the conference remains uncertain for now."

A new border would be drawn between the two nations, splitting the region roughly evenly and following ethnic boundaries. The initial map presented seemed rather... unappealing, but a more refined version with less irregular borders proved to be more satisfactory.\n\nThe Aquileian dignitaries were hesitant however.

While money is good to have, getting it would not liberate Tarrin. However, Tarrin might be a sacrifice Aquileia must be willing to make to secure an alliance with the mighty Kingdom of Wingbardy."

Considering Francistria has been Wingbardy's ally for years and fought alongside them in the Falcor War, this act is tantamount to spitting on the graves of Francistrian soldiers who gave up their lives in Wingbardy's war.\n\nClearly, Francistrian delegates must protest this. But the unfortunate truth is that they have little leverage over the two major powers. Most they can do is threaten to leave the [WNG.GetFactionName], but this would simply allow Aquileia to seize Tarrin by force.

 wingbardy.25.d:0 "During the tense diplomatic meetings held in Eaglers during the Tarrin Conference, the Wingbardian dignitaries approached Aquileian ones in private and made a rather... unusual offer. They offered a compromise solution in an attempt to please both Aquileia and Francistria. A new border would be drawn between the two nations, splitting the region roughly evenly and following ethnic boundaries. The initial map presented seemed rather... unappealing, but a more refined version with less irregular borders proved to be more satisfactory.\n\nWhen the Francistrian delegates heard of this however, they were hesitant. It was a half-hearted solution, and would mean splitting the region for many years to come. Perhaps tensions would simply reappear later? The diplomats had a difficult choice to make."
 wingbardy.25.a:0 "This is good enough for us."
 wingbardy.25.b:0 "Tarrin is indivisible!"

 wingbardy.26.d:0 "During the tense diplomatic meetings held in Eaglers during the Tarrin Conference, the Wingbardian dignitaries approached Aquileian ones in private and made an intriguing offer. They offered monetary compensation for the loss of Tarrin, covering the costs of the Francistrian occupation over the last thirty years or so.\n\nThis was proof to Francistrian delegates that Wingbardy was still ready to support its old allies instead of simply bowing before Aquileian posturing. The reparations were unlikely to please Aquileia, but the fact that Wingbardy was offering to pay it out of their own pockets impressed Francistrians. Clearly, Wingbardy was doing everything it could to show to the world that they had not forgotten everything Francistria had done for them."
 wingbardy.26.a:0 "They get money, we get Tarrin. Everyone's happy!"

 wingbardy.27.t:0 "Aquileia Agrees"
 wingbardy.27.d:0 "Wingbardian diplomats presented the offer to the Aquileians, and after some hesitation they accepted. This is good news and means the conference is one step closer to a successful conclusion. However, the Francistrians still need to ratify any agreements proposed for the talks to succeed. If they don't, then the agreement made with Aquileian delegates won't matter at all. If the proposal made was tailored to appease the Aquileians, then it is unlikely to please the Francistrians..."
 wingbardy.27.a:0 "Let us hope they accept this proposal."

 wingbardy.28.t:0 "Aquileia Rejects"
 wingbardy.28.d:0 "Wingbardian diplomats presented the offer to the Aquileians, and after some hesitation they politely refused. More negotiations were held in a desperate attempt to salvage the situation, but unfortunately it was all in vain. The Aquileians soon lost interest in the conference and have seemingly decided to withdraw from it entirely, seeing it as a useless way to resolve the Tarrin dispute. This made the Francistrian delegates rather pleased, although somewhat worried that Aquileians would pursue a more... violent solution to the issue.\n\nThe Tarrin Conference has failed, and tensions between Aquileia and Francistria will continue to be a thorn on the side of Wingbardy for the foreseeable future."
 wingbardy.28.a:0 "Perhaps the pen isn't mightier than the sword."

 wingbardy.29.t:0 "Francistria Agrees"
 wingbardy.29.d:0 "The Francistrian delegation was informed of the deal that had been made between Aquileian and Wingbardian representatives, and thankfully they have accepted the proposal and are willing to ratify a formal treaty between all three parties.\n\nThis means that the Tarrin Conference has been a resounding success, once again proving that the pen is mightier than the sword. Hopefully, the Tarrin dispute can be considered fully resolved so peace can now be secured between Aquileia and Francistria."
 wingbardy.29.a:0 "All that's left is to sign the papers!"

 wingbardy.30.t:0 "Francistria Rejects"
 wingbardy.30.d:0 "When the Francistrian delegation was informed of the deal that had been made between Aquileian and Wingbardian representatives, they responded with a mixture of disappointment and outrage. The fact that Wingbardy had separately negotiated with Aquileian diplomats without Francistrians was insulting to them, and they did not like the proposed treaty either. They thought it was a poor attempt at appeasing Aquileians while completely neglecting Francistrian interests.\n\nWorst of all, the Francistrian delegates threatened that their nation would withdraw from the [WNG.GetFactionName] rather than cede any part of Tarrin to Aquileia. This was a way to make a statement that Wingbardy could not decide the fate of Tarrin without Francistria's involvement.\n\nThe Wingbardian diplomats were now faced with a difficult situation. Would they recognize Aquileia's claims to the region, or stand by their long-time ally and withdraw from the negotiations entirely? Either way, the Tarrin Conference had failed. The dispute was now unlikely to be resolved peacefully."
 wingbardy.30.a:0 "It's best to let them go rather than upset Aquileia."
 wingbardy.30.b:0 "We shall stand by our Francistrian allies!"

 wingbardy.31.t:0 "The Tarrin Talks Pass"
 wingbardy.31.d:0 "The Aquileian delegation in Eaglers received good news, as Wingbardian negotiators managed to make Francistrians agree to the proposal. This means that all three parties were willing to ratify a treaty to finally resolve the Tarrin dispute. Indeed, within hours a final treaty was drafted and signed by all delegates involved. The compromise went into effect on the following day, and all sides were quick to follow its conditions.\n\nThus, peace was established between Aquileia and Francistria, and it was hoped the peace would last for many years to come."

 wingbardy.32.t:0 "Tarrin Talks Fail"
 wingbardy.32.d:0 "The Aquileian delegation in Eaglers received bad news, as Wingbardian negotiators failed to make Francistrians agree to the proposal. Francistrians threatened to leave the [WNG.GetFactionName] if Wingbardy continued to support Aquileia's claims to the region. The Wingbardian delegates were hesitant, and as a result Francistria has formally announced that it has left the alliance. Their diplomats immediately left the conference, bringing it to an abrupt ending.\n\nThis dramatic turn of events means that resolving the Tarrin dispute peacefully has failed. However, thanks to Wingbardy's support, Aquileia's claims to the regions are recognized, and an attack on Francistria might be justified. Now that Francistria is left without their powerful ally, they should be unable to resist the Aquileian military. The pen has failed, but the sword might yet succeed and bring an end to this conflict with violent force."

Francistrians threatened to leave the [WNG.GetFactionName] if Wingbardy continued to support Aquileia's claims to the region. The Wingbardian delegates caved in and withdrew their proposal to Aquileia, refusing to continue the negotiations. The Tarrin Conference quickly came to an end as the diplomats returned home with empty claws.\n\nThis dramatic turn of events means that resolving the Tarrin dispute peacefully has failed. However, solving it militarily is still an option. Conducting a swift surprise attack would catch the [WNG.GetFactionName] off guard and give Aquileia an advantage that might be all that is needed to seize Tarrin. The pen has failed, but the sword might yet succeed and bring an end to this conflict with violent force."

 wingbardy.34.t:0 "The Dream"
 wingbardy.34.d:0 "Garibald Talonuel stepped out of the light of the doorway and onto the smooth cobbles of the courtyard. The grand walls of the Imperial Palace stood high all around. The golden light glowed in the many windows like the sun rising on a hall of mirrors. He could still hear the laughs from the decadent Griffenheim elite, but the part was anything but jovial. There was a pressure in the air. Like a string under tension on the verge of snapping. Surely everyone but the 12-year old Emperor could feel it.\n\nKing Gumberto of Wingbardy had kept a civil face throughout the whole ordeal and when Emperor Grover V had drifted asleep on his throne, he had taken his leave. \"Meet me outside in fifteen minutes,\" the king said to Garibald. Now Garibald peered out into the dim light of the courtyard. It wasn't long until a pair of griffons came into sight, even in the darkness he could make out his father's shape. He headed towards them. The pair of griffons argued in hushed voices. Suddenly there was the flash of a knife and a half-scream choked out of existence as it left his father's throat.\n\nGaribald held his father in his arms, not caring for the blood that soiled his robes. There was so much of it. He screamed for help, but his father took his claw. The king tried to say something but all that came out was one last choke before he went limp.\n\nThe nobles came one by one and gathered around them like a wake of vultures. Even the young emperor still holding his doll and rubbing the sleep from his eyes – The Duke of Strawberry made sure he had a front row seat.\n\nGaribald awoke, not with a start, but with a pained tiredness. The early light of dawn lazily flowed through his windows. He glanced at the photograph by his bed of his late wife and young son before slowly rising to his feet. He stepped out onto his villa's balcony and stared out across the olive trees and vineyards. His father's killer was still out there, somewhere. All these years later he was no closer to the truth. But it was never too late to start looking."
 wingbardy.34.a:0 "Life is too short..."
 
 wingbardy.35.t:0 "The Exiled King"
 wingbardy.35.d:0 "Recently King Garibald of Wingbardy was forced to flee his homeland. He has crossed our borders and sought official refuge in our country. Due to the extended conflict with communist and republican forces in his realm, it does not look like he will be returning any time soon. Until such a time comes when he can reclaim the throne, we will gladly grant asylum to the rightful king of Wingbardy."
 wingbardy.35.a:0 "He'll be safe with us."

 wingbardy.36.t:0 "Crisis in the PLW"
 wingbardy.36.d:0 "With Gallo Ventriglio's faliure to prevent Beakolini's March on Karthin and his dismissal as Prime Minister, the Partito Liberale Wingbardo have voted to replace him with their old leader Giovanni Giolitti. Giolitti has long been a predominant and respected voice in Wingbardian politics and has been Prime Minister five times in the past, both under King Garibald Talonuel III and his father King Gumburto.\n\nGiolitti has approached Beakolini for talks of forming a coalition government, offering the full support of the PLW. This might just be a move to keep some semblance of power for the PLW, but regardless having their support will help us greatly in pushing through our reforms in a timely manner."
 wingbardy.36.a:0 "We accept this support."
 wingbardy.36.b:0 "We don't need no help from those so-called liberals."

 wingbardy.37.t:0 "The PDSW has Offered Their Support"
 wingbardy.37.d:0 "Giovanni Giolitti, leader of the PLW, has been in talks with Giovanni Antonio Golonna and the leadership of the radical Partito Democratico Sociale Wingbardo over their inclusion into our governing coalition. It seems that through his political respect he has won over the PDSW's leadership and they are now fully ready to support Beakolini and the PNF. This will give us the edge in the Chamber of Deputies and help ensure that we can push through the laws we need to secure fascism in Wingbardy."
 wingbardy.37.a:0 "Those radicals will get more change then they bargained for."

 wingbardy.38.t:0 "The Gacerbo Law"
 wingbardy.38.d:0 "Initially created by a PNF economist named Giacomo Gacerbo, the Gacerbo Law as it is named after him is a proposal for a parliamentary reform, one specifically aimed at the proportions gained from voting in deputies. The hopes is that this will cement the fascists' power in the parliament and allow Beakolini to continue his measures unabated.\n\nIn short, the law would state that whatever party got the largest share of the votes, provided that they had at least twenty-five percent of them, was guaranteed to get at least two-thirds the seats in parliament. The remaining third would be shared among the other parties proportionally. Should this law be passed, it would also start early elections to allow a reshuffle of the parliament.\n\nWith the PNF's popularity higher then any other party's at the moment, our chances of winning and securing the parliament should the law pass are all but secured. The challenge, howere, will be to get the law through in the first place. For if our coalition supporting the government isn't large enough to get it through, then it will surely have no chance of succeeding..."
 wingbardy.38.a:0 "Let us hope it goes through without a hitch."

 wingbardy.39.t:0 "The Early Election"
 wingbardy.39.d:0 "The polls were once again opened to all Wingbardians today, for the recent passing of the Gacerbo Law has mandated a new early election to reshuffle and reorganize the parliament. And just as hoped, the PNF got a vast majority of votes compared to the rest of the parties, securing their two-thirds majority we needed in deputies. The results in some states were seriously questioned due to rumors of voter intimidation, electoral fraud and other such acts by Blackwing members, but nevertheless they have now been generally accepted and the PNF given their rightful seats as mandated by the Gacerbo Law. We now have our safe majority in the Chamber of Deputies, and our great Duce Beakolini finally has the ability to fully carry out his goals for the future of Wingbardy."
 wingbardy.39.a:0 "Just as Planned."
 wingbardy.39.b:0 "This requires more drastic actions."

 wingbardy.40.t:0 "The Gacerbo Law Passes"
 wingbardy.40.d:0 "A great victory for fascism in Wingbardy has been achieved today, as the Gacerbo Law has passed parliament and became law just a few hours ago. With it, the elections that have been rescheduled to occur in just a month are practically guaranteed to give us the majority of deputies we need, finally allowing us to go forward with our vision for the nation. Many in the party are celebrating this as a turning point, as the balance of power has finally shifted permanently in favor of Beakolini and the PNF."
 wingbardy.40.a:0 "A rousing success!"

 wingbardy.41.t:0 "The Gacerbo Law Fails"
 wingbardy.41.d:0 "A major setback has occured yestreday, as the Gacerbo Law has failed to pass through parliament and was rejected by the deputies. Without it, we have no way of securing a majority in the chamber, and Beakolini is still being continuously hampered by the efforts of the opposition. While we tried to do things the lawful and peaceful way, it may be time to switch our focus to Plan B, despite objections..."
 wingbardy.41.a:0 "Curses!"

 wingbardy.42.t:0 "Divisions in the PPW"
 wingbardy.42.d:0 "It appears that gaining the support of the Prelate was a greater success then we first thought. The PPW has long been a thorn in our side, however with the Prelate's backing we have won over a substantial portion of their voter base to support us. This has caused a crisis within the PPW with many Deputies now speaking out against the party's hard like anti-fascist policy. It is reported that Don Luigi Guturzo was severely distressed by the Prelate's support for Beakolini and after a private meeting with the Prelate he resigned as head of the PPW. His successor is his right-claw griffon Giovanni De Gaspwingi.\n\nWhile De Gaspwingi opposes us just as much as Don Guturzo, he is now leading a party that is very much divided and will not pose a significant unified threat against us."
 wingbardy.42.a:0 "Just as planned."

 wingbardy.43.t:0 "The Prelate's Support"
 wingbardy.43.d:0 "The Prelate of Karthin in Wingbardy was a very important griffon. Being the spiritual leader to thousands of Wingbardians, his word and opinion was valued by many, from the common griff on his everyday issues to politicians on gaining the support of the religious. And that latter reason was exactly why Beakolini was approaching to meet him today, in hopes of gaining that critical support that could sway many of both the people and the parliament.\n\nUnfortunately, Beakolini would not be able to use many of his normal tactics here. The Prelate was a faithful and holy griffon, and trying to intimdate or bribe him would only end in disaster. Some said that the gods gave him the ability to see through lies as well. So the only thing he could do was to speak with him, be honest about his intentions, and hope that they would give him their blessing.\n\nIt seems that the gods were on our side today, though, as the Prelate blessed Beakolini inside the holy temple in Karthin. And later that day, they made a public statement lending his support to our cause. It immediately had the effect we intended, as griffons across all layers of society reconsidered their stance on the PNF, giving us some much needed votes."
 wingbardy.43.a:0 "A toast to our new friendship."

 wingbardy.44.t:0 "Giacomo Gatteotti Speaks Out Against Fascism"
 wingbardy.44.d:0 "Trouble against the PNF has risen in the parliament once again, as Giacomo Gatteotti, leader of the PSU party has made yet another speech denouncing both Beakolini's leadership and fascism as a whole in Wingbardy. Having long been the head of the democratic socialist party, he has ardently stood against the new Prime Minister since his first day in office, constantly pushing for the griffons of parliament to unite against him and the PNF. It seems that a large part of our opposition agreed with his rousing moment, and the griffon is proving to be a real thorn in our side. Beakolini has already expressed his displeasure at the constant attempts to undermine him."
 wingbardy.44.a:0 "Who will rid me of these communists?"

 wingbardy.45.t:0 "Giacomo Gatteotti Disappears"
 wingbardy.45.d:0 "Shocking news has spread across Wingbardy as of late, for Giacomo Gatteotti, head of the PSU has mysteriously disappeared. While his whereabouts are unknown at the moment, witnesses say that they saw the socialist leader being bundled into a car by masked attackers. The search for him continues, yet many are already fearing that it is too late. It seems that the blame for the attack is being put mostly onto the local Blackwings, which have long had a violent history with such incidents. Both the local police and PSU members have cooperated in locating the missing politician."
 wingbardy.45.a:0 "This isn't what I meant!"

 wingbardy.46.t:0 "Giacomo Gatteotti's Body Found"
 wingbardy.46.d:0 "The worst fears of many came true a few days ago, as the body of Giacomo Gatteotti was finally found, hidden deep in the Warthog Jungle. A later autopsy by medical experts found that he had been stabbed no less than seven times by his assailants. Many in the PSU and beyond are in mourning, as Giacomo was a generally well-liked figure among the liberals and socialists for his moderate policies. While the party itself has fractured some and brought more into the PNF, the vast majority are already directing their anger at the government for letting this happen, as well as fanning the suspicion of Blackwing involvement."
 wingbardy.46.a:0 "I swear, I had nothing to do with this!"

 wingbardy.47.t:0 "Fascists Arrested over Gatteotti's Murder"
 wingbardy.47.d:0 "The griffons behind the murder of Giacomo Gatteotti have finally been caught, as the police have apprehended five individuals who were in relation to the crime. The evidence against them at this point is overwhelming, and many legal experts are already guaranteeing it to be an open-and-shut case. In a turn to the worse for the PNF and Beakolini, though, one of the alleged murderers is known and prominent Blackwing officer. Rumors are already spreading of Beakolini's possible involvement of the murder, due to Gatteotti's known opposition to his government.\n\nTwo options have been put forward by our officials. The first is to save face and let the trial go ahead. While it would undoubtedly hurt the reputation and popularity of the PNF as a whole, Beakolini's innocence in the case would be proved and the government itself could get off scotch-free. The other option is to use our connections to get them off the hook. Our party wouldn't take the hit that an actual conviction could bring, but it would only increase suspicions of Beakolini's involvement and erode trust in the government."
 wingbardy.47.a:0 "Beakolini is innocent. The trial should go ahead."
 wingbardy.47.b:0 "Pull strings to get them off without charge."

 wingbardy.48.t:0 "A New Plan"
 wingbardy.48.d:0 "The failure of the Gacerbo Law to pass have been a devastating blow to our efforts in Wingbardy. Without it, the parliament will continue to delay and hinder Beakolini in pushing forward his plans. Now that our motion to achieve full dominance in Wingbardian politics has failed, it is clear that our only option left is to take much more drastic measures.\n\nPlans are already being drawn up for a coup of the current government. Though it is unfortunate, acting against the king and those that oppose Beakolini is not only necessary to advance our interests, it is necessary for the future of Wingbardy itself. The Blackwings, the PNF and the rest of those loyal to fascism are already preparing for what must be done."

They seem eager to learn of our experiences in tank warfare, and the Wingbardian general staff has already offered to share their knowledge of more general griffon warfare from their training and the Falcor War. Though it is certain that we could benefit from this in planning and tactics, if the fascists ever betray us later they will have benefited as much as we have."

The committee consists of Antonino Proletarino with the PCW, Giovanni Gacci of the PSW, and Giovanni De Gaspwingi of the PPW, bringing together a wide coalition of parties centered in Wrobert.\n\nMeanwhile around Falcor and Asbolus, Beakolini has received the blessing of King Talonuel to end the war, and now leads his Blackwings along with the rest of the royal army to put down the revolution. Fighting has already broken out all across the nation, as both sides seem willing to fight to the bitter end. Who will achieve victory though, is not yet certain."

It seems that peace has finally returned to Wingbardy.\n\nHowever, the troubles within are not yet finished.

However, peace has not yet returned to Wingbardy.\n\nThe Francistrians, now allied with the fascists, continues to fight against what they call the "unlawful traitors of Wingbardy". It seems that we will not be safe until all the bastions of fascism are rooted out, and so we will march on until we can all see peace once more!"

The Chamber of Deputies was almost immediately secured with the various ministers rounded up, and the King's Palace was locked down. All across the nation, local governments either complied with the new leaders or were forced to at gunpoint, ensuring that there was no possible pushback. As soon as Wingbardy was confirmed secure, Beakolini announced a state of emergency due to recent events and instated martial law across the entire nation. Though he assured Wingbardians that this was only temporary, there was also not a set time or date when it would be lifted.\n\nWhile our mission to secure our control was a success, and now we are unopposed in going forward with our goals, there is still one last issue to address. King Garibald Talonuel III, the ruler of Wingbardy is still inside his palace, guarded by our most loyal Blackwings. This would be a rare opportunity to dispose of the king if we so wish, as he no longer wields any real power. With the current situation, not many griffons would be able to object. However, the king is still beloved by many of his people, and the soldiers of Wingbardy. Allowing him to remain, even if only as a puppet, may be more beneficial to Beakolini and the country as a whole."

 wingbardy.70.d:0 "Three knocks against the door of his office shook Giovanni Gacci awake from his nap. It had been the first nap he had since he joined the revolution. It seemed some griffon had other plans for him tonight, though. Another knock, more incessant. \"Come in, I'm here.\" When the door opened, the socialist leader widened his eyes at the sight before him. Three armed griffons, barely adults, entered, along with Antonino Proletarino, the leader of the PCW. The latter put a stack of papers on Gacci's desk.\n\"Ah, mister Gacci, enjoying your rest?\"\n\"Cut to the chase Anton, and please put those guns downs, you will hurt somegriff.\" The three hesitated, slightly lowering their rifles.\n\"Thank you for your speech in the Chamber today, Giovanni, a few words from you and the liberals who opposed our cause fled Karthin!\"\n\nWas Anton really just starting another coup? \"Our cause, or yours? Look at you, reveling in the power of the gun. The power of the fasces!\" Giovanni stood up, causing three rifles to point at him, the barrels shaking from unsteady claws.\n\"I am no fascist!\" The communist slammed Gacci's desk. \"I will protect the revolution. I will not let you stop me! Now sign this.\"\nGacci read the papers. \"What is this. . . arrest warrants? A party fusion? No griffon is going to believe this! You are subverting the will of the people!\" Gacci's protests were met with silence. Giovanni slumped back down in his seat, looking up at the four faces staring at him. The griffon felt his heart pound in his chest. His desk drawer had his handgun in it, loaded. He did not expect the future of Wingbardian democracy to come down to his own personal bravery, but here he was. Gacci reached his claw down to his drawer. . ."
 wingbardy.70.a:0 "\"You leave me no choice, let me just grab my pen.\""
 wingbardy.70.b:0 "\"You leave me no choice. . .\" Grab the gun."

 wingbardy.701.t:0 "The Transfer of Power"
 wingbardy.701.d:0 "Giovanni Gacci squeezed his gun in the drawer for a second and then closed his eyes, letting go of it, instead pulling out his pen with a deep sigh.\n\"Very good, now sign.\" Antonino tapped the desk impatiently as Gacci went through and signed all the documents. The socialist leader lowered his pen when he was done and Proletarino quickly snatched the papers, checking the signature. \"Thank you for your cooperation Gionvanni.\" With a dramatic turn, the new leader of Wingbardy left Gacci's office, his three goons following suit.\n\nThe socialist leader slumped in his chair, a thousand regrets on his mind. A few hours later he turned on the radio to hear an audibly confused radio host read the forged statements of his departure from politics and the end of the Wingbardian Socialist Party. The PCW was in charge now, but at least none of those kids would have had to see a body. At least he'd get to see the morning. Gacci stood up and walked out of his office, closing the door behind him. He sighed again, turning around and making his way home. Tomorrow the sun would shine again. But would Wingbardy ever shine again? Would his own eyes every shine, would his heart be warm?"
 wingbardy.701.a:0 "At least it isn't Beakolini . . ."

 wingbardy.702.t:0 "The Blood Red Banner"
 wingbardy.702.d:0 "In the blink of an eye Giovanni Gacci had pulled out his gun, aiming it straight for Proletarino's heart and pulling the trigger. The communist let out a scream, looking at his chest with unbelief. His glasses fell from his beak, the glass cracking. He then muttered something too soft for any griffon in the room to understand. As Gacci had hoped, the three young griffons did not fire in the moment, although one had her talon on the trigger. The socialist managed to soften his voice as his colleague squirmed on the floor. \"What is your name, miss?\"\n\"Gianna. . .\" the other two stared in disbelief as she aimed her rifle determinedly. \"What is your job Gianna?\"\n\"I work at a Wrobert dockyard, mister Gacci.\" She stepped forward, her rifle aimed at the griffon's forehead.\n\"I see. Thank you for helping us. Without Wrobert, the revolution wouldn't have been possible.\"\n\"And you did nothing! The PCW always helped us dockers!\"\n\nGiovanni's eyes widened in fear, but he pressed on. \"Don't think about what I did, but about what I will do. If you lower your rifle, your fight will be over. If you shoot, who knows?\"\n\"I just. . .\" Her grip weakened.\n\"How about you all go home? You have done your part, now let me do mine.\" Gianna lowered her rifle hesitantly and Gacci managed a smile when the three young adults sat down on the floor. The socialist party leader tore his national flag from the wall and draped it over Proletarino's body. The gentle pink and purple hues soon turned red with blood. . ."
 wingbardy.702.a:0 "May his blood be the last spilled for this flag."

 wingbardy.71.t:0 "Wingbardian Communists Ask For Support"
 wingbardy.71.d:0 "News from Wingbardy recently has been nothing but alarming. It appears that the country is on the brink of being taken over by fascists under the leadership of Beakolini. Fortunately for the griffons there, an alliance of leftwing forces has been preparing to stop the fascists' rise to power by force. The Partito Communista Wingbardo, the Wingbardian Communist Party, has managed to use its connections here in Stalliongrad to sneak in a request for aid. The rebels are going to need guns and whatever else we can spare, but there is no guarantee that if we do this, the communists will be strong enough to take power themselves."
 wingbardy.71.a:0 "We will help our griffon comrades."

They are not quite sure when they will reach Karthin, but their help will be priceless in the upcoming conflict."
 wingbardy.72.a:0 "This will be useful."

 wingbardy.73.t:0 "Stalliongrad Refuses to Help"
 wingbardy.73.d:0 "It seems the PCW has either overestimated its own influence in Stalliongrad or the ponies' commitment to the ideal of international revolution. Either way, we cannot expect help from the communists at this time, an embarrassment for Proletarino, to be sure."
 wingbardy.73.a:0 "Are they truly communists?"

 wingbardy.74.t:0 "Equipment from Stalliongrad Arrives"
 wingbardy.74.d:0 "At nine in the morning yesterday, the huge cargo freighter ‘Vechnokrasnyy' steamed into Wrobert harbour and crews of dockers with red armbands rushed aboard to help the ponies unload its invaluable cargo. They carried crates of munitions of all calibres, along with rifles, sidearms and grenades. Then came crates full of medical supplies, tents and everything else needed. Lastly, twenty-five artillery pieces, which took a dozen griffons to roll off the ship safely. The Stalliongradians surely provided for the revolution!\n\nSadly, as the ship left the harbour, it managed to get lodged sideways at the harbour's entrance, unable to move and blocking all traffic in and out. Workers are currently working on pushing the ship back into the water and send the Vechnokrasnyy back on her way to Stalliongrad."

 wingbardy.79.t:0 "The Conscription Question"
 wingbardy.79.d:0 "As battle lines coalesce along partisan loyalties, serious questions have arisen regarding the recruitment of soldiers. The hopes for a swathe of willing volunteers have been dashed, and our commanders are desperately calling for new recruits. The obvious solution to this deficit would be enforcing conscription, but there are possible issues.\n\nShould we call upon drafted Wingbardians, many of them might not be in line with our ideals and committed to our cause. This, of course, means that they are not as willing to fight on as our more ardent volunteers and possibly lead to future problems such as desertion or, worse, defection. There is also the matter of 'diluting' the cause with griffons who aren't already supporting us.\n\nHowever, realities on the ground make it clear that we will be at a severe disadvantage if we do not enact conscription. We may have to sacrifice somewhat on our ideals to carry the revolution through to victory."
 wingbardy.79.a:0 "We need every griffon we can get."
 wingbardy.79.b:0 "The revolution shall be voluntary."

 wingbardy.80.t:0 "Good Help"
 wingbardy.80.d:0 "The revolution is in full swing now, but domestic policies still require solving if we want to further our cause in the long run. We're forming our cabinet and, in turn, our government. It's become evident that there is a schism forming between the reformists and the radicals, and it would be in our best interest to placate at least one of these wings by inviting their influential members into our government. In this case, two candidates are available.\n\nGivanoe Wingomi is from the party's reformist wing and has long since been a strong, moderate voice in the party. He is a true believer in the cause and has pledged full support. However, Wingomi still believes that there is merit with some of the more outdated old system institutions that can be reformed in service to the revolution. Being a creature born from politics, Givanoe knows the inner workings of government and is well used to it, making him an obvious pick for an advisory position in our new state.\n\nAlternatively, the novelist Gennaro Bordiclaw is Wingomi's opposite in most respects. The more ardent and idealist among the party's radicals, Gennaro is known for his rhetoric pushing for greater freedoms and ideals in his writings. Were he to be appointed, not only would it appease the radicals, but Bordiclaw's writings may finally be applied and prove that we can go beyond. For the people and for the world.\n\nHowever, we may wish to forego appointing either one of these griffons to office. After all, giving power to one wing might rob us of our desired revolution."
 wingbardy.80.a:0 "Givanoe Wingomi will help keep stability."
 wingbardy.80.b:0 "Gennaro Bordiclaw is a true revolutionary!"

 wingbardy.81.t:0 "Gallus' Visit"
 wingbardy.81.d:0 "Gallus got off the train car at possibly the worst time. It was late afternoon in Karthin, and a serious change of pace for the young griffon. Griffons all around him speaking in Wingbardian and Francistrian dialects, complete gibberish to the Griffonstone raised chick.\n\n"Oh gods oh no what in the world do I do." Gallus muttered to himself. Flying high above the station he looked around at the ancient city of Karthin. From the old districts to the modern ones, he was completely overwhelmed. It was an entirely different city than Griffonstone, more like Manehattan than his home. "Alright Gallus, you got this. That invitation from the Gaspwingi fella said to meet him at parliament. Not sure where I’m supposed to go, or what it even looks like. But Twilight said she trusts me with this. And I can’t disappoint my old professor."\n\nGallus began to fly about the city, trying to find anything he could notice. Karthin was like a maze, and it was easy to get lost even while flying. But finally, he noticed a landmark he knew from a history book. Some obelisk the Karthinians took a few hundred years ago that they now sat in front of their parliament building. Swooping down, Gallus saw a pretty inconspicuous building, but he trusted this was what he was looking for.\n\n"Now, how do I find Mr. Gaspwingi..." Gallus looked around and saw a guard by a door on the side of the building. Deciding it was his best way in he floated down to ground level and approached the guard.\n\n"Umm, hello sir! My name is Gallus from Griffonstone and I am here to see uhh..." Gallus rummaged around in his bag before pulling out the letter, "Deputy Giovanni De Gaspwingi. He wanted me to meet with him?"\n\nThe guard cocked his head, "Eh? Deputato Gaspwingi?" The guard was supremely confused and began to shuffle away from the small griffon to a booth by the door.\n\nGallus slammed his head into his claw, "Oh right, I don’t speak Wingbardian."\n\nThe guard emerged accompanied by another griff, wearing a ruffled suit, who approached Gallus and began to speak in extremely broken Herzlander, "You are griffon from Equestria yes?" Gallus nodded, not wanting to explain he hadn’t been there in a while, and was only coming here because Twilight asked him to. "Yes yes, you meet with government, teach friendship!" Grabbing Gallus by the shoulder the suited griffon dragged him inside the parliament building."

 wingbardy.144.t:0 "The Gattei Way"
 wingbardy.144.d:0 "The foundation of the AGWP has not been an easy affair. Due to the poor economic situation of the kingdom, the project was originally underfunded. The original chairgriffon put in charge of the operation quickly departed for fear he was set up for failure or worse. In his stead emerged Genrico Gattei. Gattei was known as a rather crafty industrialist in Taloncana. Some of his ventures were impacted but instead of abandoning them like some others when the AGWP was created, he embraced it and began to lobby the government over participation in it. After all within the government began to see the position as doomed to fail, it was awarded to Gattei.\n\nUnder Gattei's leadership, the company was reorganised more efficiently along less bureaucratic lines. However, the budget of the AGWP was still an issue. Gattei's answer to it was the Taloncana scheme. With much fanfare and press coverage, he announced that incredibly rich methane and oil deposits were found in Taloncana and that soon, Wingbardy would become oil-independent. This quickly rose confidence in the company and many rich Wingbardians and capitalists began to buy into it, providing the company with some much-needed cash.\n\nThe reality was a bit less fantastic. Oil deposits were indeed found but they were very poor compared to the methane reserves. What he did was using natural gas instead to boost the development of national industry in the region. The gas would be a cheaper and more functional substitute for the all-important coal imported at great expenses. As many of these industry belonged to Gattei's family or friends, he benefited highly from the move. This could have been one of the greatest scandal in Wingbardian history but the move ultimately lead to a boom in the region and the high profits were plowed back into the various branches of the AGWP, allowing to grow even more and strike actual oil deposits.\n\nFar from getting fired over the scheme, Gattei became a media darling and a powerful political actor. Some are calling him corrupt and the move a threat to our government's integrity. Gattei prefers to call himself 'innovative'."

 wingbardy_flavour.5.d:0 "It had been a few days since Prime Minister Ventriglio had briefed the Chamber of Deputies about the March on Karthin and the rallying of the blackwings. Although the head of government had promised action, the left wing of the Chamber decided to take matters into their own claws. In a side room of the parliament building, the unlikely alliance was ready to formalise. In attendance were the leader of the orthodox communist party, Antonino Proletarino, considered an extremist by the others leaders. Giovanni Gacci and Giacomo Gatteotti represented the revolutionary and reformist wings of the socialist party respectively. Gacci was a popular journalist and intellectual, who successfully brought many working class griffons outside of Wrobert into the socialist movement, while Gatteotti’s unitary faction was a growing democratic faction in the party. Lastly, there was Guto Golajanni, representing the Republican Party of Wingbardy. His party was by far the smallest in attendance, but behind the aged criminologist’s gentle features lay a fierce anti-fascist republican with important connections.\n\nAt the meeting, the gentlegriffs decided to form the National Liberation Committee and to evacuate Karthin with their parties. They would meet again in the port city of Wrobert, where the socialist movement was firmly established and where they would have little to fear from fascist agitators. Sympathetic officers would be contacted and socialist and republican organisations would be rallied and organised as best as possible. When the meeting was over, the air in the room felt heavy. The actions the griffons had committed themselves to were dangerous to their very persons, but they all knew that they had only one chance to stop fascism. Proletarino was the only one somewhat excited at the revolutionary plotting, while Golajanni seemed somewhat uneasy between the far left leaders. Gacci and Gatteotti, who could not stand each other normally, finally seemed in agreement, a reminder of the strength of a united Socialist Party."

 wingbardy_flavour.6.d:0 "The shadow of night hid four of the Red Guard’s best shooters on the rooftops of Karthin’s central district. Their rifles were pointed towards a well-lit building. It was a concrete insult to aesthetics tainting the otherwise ornate city-centre. The building was nicknamed ‘The Monster’ for its hideousness. It had been built after Wingbardian independence to hold arms for the royal army in case of a republican uprising. Now, the arms inside would topple the monarchy which commissioned it.\n\nAlmost simultaneously, four shots rang in the dark and four bodies dropped in front of the building. Below the sharpshooters, dozens of griffons wearing red bands emerged from basements, rushing towards the entrance. As surprised guards went outside to check on the gunfire, they were quickly mobbed and struck to the ground by the Red Guards, who used the opportunity to get inside of the Monster. Exactly five minutes later, a series of trucks ran up to the building, with the red guards who went inside returning with as many rifles and munitions as they could carry, the alarms blaring into the otherwise silent city. Before the carabinieri or the army arrived on the scene, the convoy of trucks was already racing out of the city, joining the rest of the Red Guard on their exodus of Karthin to the new revolutionary headquarter of Wrobert.\n\nNews of the successful raid on the Monster quickly spread through Wingbardy the next day, as an embarrassment for the government and the fascists, who planned to use those rifles themselves. The Red Guard also received a lot of recruits the following days, as many griffons sought to join the dashing brigades of the revolution, hoping to one day perform such heroic deeds themselves."

However, their mood changed for the better when they realised the building was surrounded by fascists, who were locked in a sort of quasi-siege with the carabinieri, who were dutifully protecting the deputies, their staff and their families inside the building. There was no way to do this in a subtle way, so the Red Guard rallied every member it had in the city and descended on the blackwings. The square in front of the Chamber became a massive brawl, claws clawing, clubs swinging and bricks and bottles flying through the air. This was the culmination of years of brawls in salons, on squares and other meeting places and all the pent up rage both sides felt. After a few minutes of violence, it appeared that the Red Guard had underestimated how many blackwings were already in the capital, as more and more fascists appeared. The situation looked helpless, until a cordon of heavily armed carabinieri descended from the steps of the Chamber.\n\nThe policegriffons started to systematically clear the square of blackwings, allowing the socialist militia to take care of their wounded and rush inside the chamber. Inside they found the Prime Minister, along with members of his party and the other liberals. Before the fascists could send reinforcements or the King could send the army after them, the Red Guard evacuated every griffon in the building out of Karthin. The escape of the liberal politicians and the bruised pride of the fascists shored up support for the democratic faction of the National Liberation Committee, with many deputies finally openly denouncing the imminent fascist coup."

This will be done through mutual cooperation and the formation of a common market. Many see it as the first step on the road to a United States of Southern Griffonia."

A skirmish broke out between the colonial garrison and Abyssinian police with both sides blaming the other.\n\nThe incident has since spiralled out of control and a build-up of forces on both sides of the border suggests that soon the dispute will soon escalate into all-out war."

 POLITICS_BEAKOLINI_DESC:0 "Giulio Beakolini was born to a middle class family in 954, and from early age, he had a deep interest in politics. His family's republican leanings made them ardent supporters of the Republican Revolution in Griffonia, and their eventual defeat did not weaken, but rather intensify, young Giulio's support for the cause, especially the more radical left branches of the movement. During his younger years, he worked as a journalist and became a famous firebrand within the left wing of Wingbardian politics.\n\nThe Falcorian war, however, turned into a watershed moment for the young Beakolini, and unlike most of his peer, he was in full support of the war. Through it, he saw the workers being empowered through the fighting and a chance to bring together a divided land. This led to him being ostracized as a warmongerer, and he ended up fired, being told he could go fight the war himself if he viewed it as something good. Beakolini chose to take the insult literally and joined the Wingbardian army, where his zeal and determination let him become part of the elite Wingbardian Bersaglieri.\n\nWhen peace came, he was a changed griff, and whereas many had been broken on the battlefield, he had found his purpose. He returned to writing, only this time for his own ideology, and ever since then, he has tirelessly written for and organized his own political movement; the 'Blackwings'. He has realized that republicanism is weak and corrupt, socialism a false idol that will break apart the nation. The new path forward organizes the entire nation as one entity, where all griffs are soldiers for Wingbardy's glory. He has named this movement Fascism, and under it, he will see Wingbardy rise to become the master of Griffonia, or die trying."

 POLITICS_GALLO_VENTRIGLIO_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 16th November 946\n\n§YBiography§!:  Gallo Ventriglio graduated from the University of Talonin with a degree in law. He became a lawyer and solicitor and eventually entered politics, becoming a councillor and then mayor of the town of Plumerolo.\n\nWhen the Falcor War broke out, he joined anti-war movements and denounced the conflict that would claim the life of his son, Giovanni Ventriglio, who was shot down while on a bombing mission over Falcor.\n\nIn recent years, he was appointed Prime Minister after the collapse of the Gonomi government. His outspokenness against Beakolini's fascist movement has lead to many hoping for a quick crackdown of the Blackwings."

 ### Traits ###
 WNG_oil_genius:0 "Administrative Genius"

 ### OLD FOCUSES ###
 ### FASCIST ###
 WNG_a_fascist_prime_minister:0 "A Fascist Prime Minister"
 WNG_a_fascist_prime_minister_desc:0 "The King has invited Beakolini to form a government as Prime Minister. Beakolini, after a moment of hesitation, has graciously accepted the position."
 WNG_trains_run_on_time:0 "Make the Trains Run on Time"
 WNG_trains_run_on_time_desc:0 "A tardy train is annoying, but a dozen late trains per day is economically unsustainable. By adopting new regulations based on incentives and punishments, we can maximise our railroad efficiency. This is, of course, something that even the common griffon will appreciate."
 WNG_crack_down_on_communists:0 "Crackdown on the Communists"
 WNG_crack_down_on_communists_desc:0 "We may have gained control of the cabinet, but we still have the issue of a dangerously polarised and militarised left. Beakolini and his ministers can pass legislation that will slowly curb the communists' powers. Prevention beats the cure, after all..."
 WNG_secure_parliament:0 "Secure the Parliament"
 WNG_secure_parliament_desc:0 "The communists have been taken care of, but our position isn't secure yet. We do not have a parliamentary majority, and the opposition could form a coalition against us. By introducing new majority policies, we can ensure full control over the parliament."
 WNG_education_reform:0 "Education Reform"
 WNG_education_reform_desc:0 "We must instigate new education policies focused on the glory of Wingbardy's past and how best the young griffons can dedicate themselves to making Wingbardy greater."
 WNG_news_censorship:0 "News Censorship"
 WNG_news_censorship_desc:0 "The newspapers often spread pro-communist rhetoric, harmful to the Wingbardian people. Il Duce, who has won awards for his truthful and honest journalism, is now able to ensure that only the truth is shared with the griffons of the nation."
 ### NEUTRAL-FASCIST DIPLO ### 
 WNG_subdue_old_allies:0 "Subdue Old Allies"
 WNG_subdue_old_allies_desc:0 "Talouse, Arantiga and Francistria all share cultural ties with Wingbardy. If we were to unite into a single state, we'd be the most powerful griffon state of the South. Let's make that into reality."
 WNG_reapproch_falcor:0 "Solidify Falcor"
 WNG_reapproch_falcor_desc:0 "The blood of over 460,000 Wingbardians was spilled in the Falcor War. While we did not start the war, through our might we brought the deceitful Falcorians to their knees. The city of Falcor was our prize. While Falcor was never truly defeated, more bloodshed is an unwelcome thought, but the city shall never be allowed to fall again."
 WNG_claim_the_throne:0 "Claim the Throne"
 WNG_claim_the_throne_desc:0 "The Empire has long since been a shadow of its former self, and an embarrassment to all of griffon Kind. Perhaps the only way to restore its ancient glory is to let a Southerner to take the throne."
 ### NEUTRAL-FASCIST INDUSTRY ###
 WNG_public_works_projects:0 "Public Works Projects"
 WNG_public_works_projects_desc:0 "With order now re-established, it is time for Wingbardy to deal with its underperforming economy. By subsidising national public works, we can immediately address the issue of unemployment. It'll take some time for the economy to recover fully, however."
 WNG_national_food_act:0 "National Food Act"
 WNG_national_food_act_desc:0 "Wingbardians may now have jobs, but they still lack food. If we can reinvigorate our own agriculture, we may be able to finally end this terrible famine and our dependence upon foreign exports."
 WNG_new_industrial_society:0 "Renewed Industries"
 WNG_new_industrial_society_desc:0 "Our economy is showing signs of recovery, but there is still much work to be done. With new investments to large corporations, our heavy industries will improve, as well as the overall economy of the country."
 ### Communist ###
 WNG_riots_in_the_streets:0 "Riots in the Streets"
 WNG_riots_in_the_streets_desc:0 "Beakolini and his Blackwings are brutes that will destroy this nation and oppress the common workers! We cannot stand for them to seize power from the rightful, if oppressive, government."
 WNG_griffons_liberation_army:0 "Griffons' Liberation Army"
 WNG_griffons_liberation_army_desc:0 "Griffons have always loved the call of battle. We should take after our fellow griffon comrades and build a new army of the proletariat for the benefit of all griffons and workers of the world."
 WNG_revolution:0 "Rivoluzione"
 WNG_revolution_desc:0 "Rise, griffons! Rise up against those who oppress you! Rise up against those who have lead this nation to ruin!"
 WNG_secure_the_griffons_republic:0 "Secure the Griffons' Republic"
 WNG_secure_the_griffons_republic_desc:0 "We may have many supporters behind us, but the factions within our new republic are fractured. They must be brought under the party's directive, politically or otherwise."
 WNG_rebuild_sociaty:0 "Rebuild Society"
 WNG_rebuild_sociaty_desc:0 "We have won the civil war, but our country lies shattered by it. By working with the remaining splinter parties, we can form a communist coalition and unify the left. Only then can we begin to heal the scars of war."
 WNG_rebuild_the_nation:0 "Rebuild the Nation"
 WNG_rebuild_the_nation:0 "The war has ravaged what little was left of our nation's industries and infrastructure. Now we have a chance to rebuild a true communist nation, and show that Wingbardy can rise stronger from the ashes."
 WNG_workers_collectives:0 "Workers' Collectives"
 WNG_workers_collectives_desc:0 "The country's rampant unemployment must be tackled, and we can begin to do so by forming strong labour unions and farming communes. This societal reform will not repair the problem in the short term, but it will bring about many benefits in the meantime."
 WNG_communist_education:0 "Communist Education"
 WNG_communist_education_desc:0 "We must re-educate society to understand and follow true communist ideals. Never again shall anyone think of themselves as more than just a cog in the communist machine."
 WNG_mines_for_miners:0 "Mines for the Miners"
 WNG_mines_for_miners_desc:0 "The dangerous occupation of the miner is now no longer under the ownership of the uncaring corporation. Mining unions will require government support to get started, but they will improve working conditions, morale and, most importantly, productivity."
 WNG_farms_for_farmers:0 "Farms for the Farmers"
 WNG_farms_for_farmers_desc:0 "The farms are now in the talons of the farmers. We should help them form collectives to ensure that they manage their own work for the benefit of themselves and all of Wingbardy."
 WNG_factories_for_labourers:0 "Factories for the Labourers"
 WNG_factories_for_labourers_desc:0 "It has been a long time coming, but the industrial labourers are now in charge. With party support, they can establish their own work schedules and conditions to increase factory output."
 WNG_join_grw:0 "Approach the Eastern Revolutionaries"
 WNG_join_grw_desc:0 "Having fought hard to cast off the shackles of the old order, the [GRW.GetName] is perhaps the best example of a communist state and among one of the more powerful ones. With enemies on all sides, an alliance with the [GRW.GetName] will only be beneficial."
 WNG_free_the_bulls:0 "Liberate the Minotaurs"
 WNG_free_the_bulls_desc:0 "Asterion has long oppressed the labourers within its borders. We cannot stand idly any longer, and we shall install the rightful government, one way or another!"
 WNG_join_aquilia:0 "Join Aquileia"
 WNG_join_aquilia_desc:0 "Aquileia and its former autonomies have united into a socialist republic after a bloody revolution, and now stands to become the dominant power in the South-West. It would only make sense to approach them with offers of an alliance."
 WNG_divide_new_mareland:0 "Divide New Mareland"
 WNG_divide_new_mareland_desc:0 "The territories that are currently occupied by the colonial imperialists are rightfully Griffonian. We can reach to the local griffon populations and make them want for both Aquileian and Wingbardian rule. Out with the Equestrians!"
 WNG_our_own_way:0 "Forging our own Path"
 WNG_our_own_way_desc:0 "There is no one that we can rely upon to free the working class except for ourselves. Wingbardy shall lead the revolution in the continent and beyond!"
 WNG_free_aquilian_workers:0 "Free the Aquileian Workers"
 WNG_free_aquilian_workers_desc:0 "The Aquileian proletariat is being stifled by their government, and thus not allowed to flourish as it has in Wingbardy. There can be no negotiation with the Aquileian state; the only way to achieve the liberation of the Aquileian is by force of arms."
 WNG_pressure_the_colonies:0 "Liberate the Ponies"
 WNG_pressure_the_colonies_desc:0 "While some scoff at the idea of ponies being able to thrive under a socialist system, we cannot overlook the fact that griffons are under foreign rule. We're a peaceful nation, so we'll offer the Equestrians the choice: relinquish griffon lands, or face war."
 ### Neutral ###
 WNG_stop_the_march:0 "Stop the March"
 WNG_stop_the_march_desc:0 "Beakolini's march is madness: he threatens the very stability of the nation. We cannot allow his band of thugs to seize power of our great nation. The police and army remains loyal to the king, and they will stop the march by any means necessary."
 WNG_brake_the_political_deadlock:0 "Break the Political Deadlock"
 WNG_brake_the_political_deadlock_desc:0 "Enough is enough. It's time to end this political deadlock once and for all. The King will address parliament and demand that they produce results. Wingbardy needs leadership, and the King will provide it."
 WNG_conservatives:0 "A Conservative Government"
 WNG_conservatives_desc:0 "What Wingbardy needs is stability. The conservatives shall form a new government, and every measure will be taken to ensure that it succeeds."
 WNG_restore_order:0 "Restoration of Order"
 WNG_restore_order_desc:0 "The time for fighting is over. It is time to rebuild our nation and we will do so together. Everygriffon shall play their part in the new Wingbardy."
 WNG_royal_acadamy_of_science:0 "The Royal Academy of Science"
 WNG_royal_acadamy_of_science_desc:0 "The Royal Academy of Science has long being the dream of the King and many of the educated elite. Now that political stability has been restored, we can take time to set up such a prestigious institution for the benefit of all Wingbardians."
 WNG_the_free_south:0 "The Free South"
 WNG_the_free_south_desc:0 "Southern Griffonia is an ancient land with its own history and culture. Never again shall we bow to northern kings and emperors; the South shall always be free."
 WNG_balance_the_books:0 "Balance the Books"
 WNG_balance_the_books_desc:0 "With our economy in shambles we must review our budget and tax plans. The nation shall rebuild itself, one coin at a time."
 WNG_strengthen_the_king:0 "Strengthen the King"
 WNG_strengthen_the_king_desc:0 "Despite our progress, the King is growing impatient with its slow pace. By taking more authority and control over the government, much of the usual bureaucratic processes can be expedited."
 WNG_aluminium:0 "Royal Aluminium Company"
 WNG_aluminium_desc:0 "The Royal Aluminium Company is a government funded organisation tasked with increasing the nation's supplies of aluminium and other metals in order to help boost Wingbardy's industrial capabilities."
 WNG_wingbardy_forever:0 "Wingbardy Forever"
 WNG_wingbardy_forever_desc:0 "Ever since time immemorial, Wingbardy has stood. It shall continue to stand until the end of time itself."
 ### Harmony ###
 WNG_librals:0 "Reinvigorate the Liberals"
 WNG_librals_desc:0 "The moderate left has often made its mark as a compromise between a conservative and a radical government. The King recognises the need for Wingbardy to start over, but will only step aside if the liberals do away with their more extreme ideas."
 WNG_embrace_harmony:0 "Embrace Harmony"
 WNG_embrace_harmony_desc:0 "Many of the PWd'A point to the stable country of Equestria over on Equus as a shining example of the concept of Harmony. Adopting a model similar to the Equestrians' may set Wingbardy on a path of restoring order."
 WNG_equestrian_aid:0 "Equestrian Aid"
 WNG_equestrian_aid_desc:0 "Having adopted Equestria's Harmonic form of government, we are in a good position to request aid from them. Being renowned for their bountiful food and giving disposition, it is highly likely Equestria will help us Wingbardians deal with the famine."
 WNG_pass_industrial_reforms:0 "Pass Industrial Reforms"
 WNG_pass_industrial_reforms_desc:0 "Now working with economic and social specialists that were traditionally left-wing, Wingbardian industry experts can set about to begin the long recovery from our economic and industrial stagnation."
 WNG_steel:0 "Privatise the Steel Industry"
 WNG_steel_desc:0 "In the past, steel and aluminium production had been government run, but have since been burdened by red tape. By allowing private companies to take over the mills with minimal government oversight, industry experts agree that our overall output will improve."
 WNG_equestrian_trade:0 "Equestrian Trade"
 WNG_equestrian_trade_desc:0 "With New Mareland as our neighbour, Wingbardy has an unique access to the Equestrian market overseas. It'd be foolish to not exploit this trade opportunity and improve our diplomatic standing with both Equestria and New Mareland."
 WNG_keep_our_friends_close:0 "Keep our Friends Close"
 WNG_keep_our_friends_close_desc:0 "With conflict intensifying abroad, Wingbardy cannot stand alone against our eventual foes. As such, we must reinforce our current alliance to ensure that we're not left alone. Even Falcor, our old enemy, may prove to be a useful ally."
 WNG_embrace_the_pony_way:0 "Embrace the Pony Way"
 WNG_embrace_the_pony_way_desc:0 "We have adopted so much from Equestria, why shouldn't we fully embrace their ways? Let the traditionalists and conservatives scoff at the idea - we know that ours is the only way to achieve true peace."
 
 WNG_school_for_gifted_griffons_desc:0 "Working with Equestria, we can establish a special academy in our nation that is inextricably linked to the famed Canterlot School for Gifted Unicorns. We may not have our own magic, but we have much to share with our pony kin as they do with us."
 WNG_harmony_with_griffon_characterises:0 "Harmony with Griffon Characteristics"
 WNG_harmony_with_griffon_characterises_desc:0 "We have striven to liken ourselves to the Equestrians, but there are hard, biological limits that makes our two species fundamentally different. There is a Griffonian spirit that cannot be suppressed and, as such, our version of Harmony must be adapted to it."
 WNG_arsenal_of_harmony:0 "Arsenal of Harmony"
 WNG_arsenal_of_harmony_desc:0 "With so much disharmony in the world, we cannot expect for things to be resolved peacefully. If Equestria won't step up, we shall be the ones to provide the arms to the righteous warriors fighting to achieve the peace that we're all after."
 WNG_cake_or_death:0 "Cake or Death"
 WNG_cake_or_death_desc:0 "It is clear that there are those who wish to sow the seeds of discord and watch the world burn. Wingbardians have always had good hearts, and we cannot abide those who purposefully seek to harm and destroy. We shall be the Blade of Harmony."
