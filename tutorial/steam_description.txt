[h1]Equestria at War[/h1] is a mod that tries to recreate the fantasy world of Equestria from My Little Pony franchise in a slightly darker setting with industrialization, corruption and political disagreements. The scenario focuses on global confrontation between Changelings and Equestria.

[h1]“Two Eagles” 1.9[/h1]

The two Kingdoms of Aquileia and Wingbardy have dominated southern Griffonia for centuries. However, even these kingdoms fell to the Griffonian Empire, although they always longed for independence. When the Empire crumbled, both nations seceded and regained some of their lost influence. 

Proud Aquileia is ruled by the Discret dynasty. The monarchy was restored to power after a counterrevolution, but many still dream of a Second Aquileian Republic. A crackdown looks inevitable, but if the republicans can coordinate revolution across the realm, the Republic might triumph once more. 

The Aquileian Eagle inspires those to her east as well, as the county of Francistria struggles with Tarrin, a region with historical ties to Aquilleia. Francistria is the domain of the Martlewing dynasty and a member of the Wingbardian alliance, but the current count seems unable to follow the martial traditions of his ancestors to rule effectively. Down south in Talouse, there is unease over Wingbardian domination. A new government will have to find a way to navigate the demands of the citizens and the demands of its large ally, or struggle for independence like the Talonsians of old!

Wingbardy itself, however, is a jewel who gradually lost her shine. Economic malaise and political deadlock have brought the country to the brink, leading to the rise of fringe political movements. Most pressingly, the rise of the fascist Beakolini is pushing the country’s democracy to the breaking point. If he succeeds in taking power, the second eagle will wield the fasces to forge a new future, but such a fate might still be prevented by royal intervention or, if all else fails, at the point of a bayonet. 

Before they can spread their wings, the Two Eagles must first secure the nest. Meanwhile, the eagles’ neighbours will have to watch carefully, as there is a fine line between being an eagle’s protégé and becoming their prey.
